== Blog objectives

Just a clarification about the progression of this blog:

. Very long and detailed posts about programming implementations e.g. Y Combinator
. I spent a lot of time to write these posts, so I gave up.
. Wrote a cli tool to handle my books and want the same to videos
. Turn this blog into a dump of notes of these videos

This notes are not properly edited and english is not my
mother language, therefore *a lot of mistakes might
happen*. I can find some time to fix the most atrocious
ones, but it will not be my main concern.


Ok, now about myself :]


== Wanderson Ferreira

Learning how to build great software and turn ideas into
reality.

Nowdays, I'm completely targeting the *Clojure* ecosystem,
however I found myself learning and experimenting with
several different technologies and languages to learn good
ideas that can be portable to other situations.
