=== *Speaker*
Stuart Halloway, Founder of Cognitect

=== *Thoughts*
I am running closely the support team at my company today
and the number of findings you get about software and people
interactions is incredible. I first didn't like the position
at all, but I was not really understanding what was
happening. The evolution of a system with your business is
very complex and interesting with tons of knowledge to take
on for future products.

=== *Quotes*
"If you don't know where you are going, you  might wind up someplace else"

"Weak *science* is *stronger* than *strong tools*"

=== _A thousand dollar slide_
Problem statements; **steps** you took, what you
**expected**, what **actually** happened
