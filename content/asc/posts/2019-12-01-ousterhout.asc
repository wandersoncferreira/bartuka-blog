=== *Thoughts*

This is a weird feeling when I program in Clojure. I've
being doing code in Python for some years before
experimenting with Clojure and I thought I could do anything
in very straight forward maneer. I started to reach some
problems with performance and looked for solutions in pypy
and other implementations of Python. But after Clojure, for
some reason I look at software with a different
perspective. I switched a *tactical* mindset towards
programming to a *strategic* one. The rationale of the
language and its core principles pushed me towards this
place.
