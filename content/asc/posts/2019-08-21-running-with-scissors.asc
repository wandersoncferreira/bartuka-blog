=== *Thoughts*

I still have difficult to understand what the sentence
_"your running program is tangible."_ I never connected to a
REPL created by running a *jar* file, but I often have some
code running in remote servers using _lein ring server_ or
something similar which I can navigate around the namespaces
and manipulate the code. I also started to leave test setup
inside a comment block. VERY USEFUL!
