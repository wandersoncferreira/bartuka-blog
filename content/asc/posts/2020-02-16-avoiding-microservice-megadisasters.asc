=== *Speaker*
Jimmy Bogard, Chief Architect at Headspring

=== *Thoughts*

We need more stories like this one to become public. Is not
easy to build these kind of architectures and people think
they know how because some video from Netflix made this so
cool to look at.

Sometimes I feel, that a third wave of refactor will reach the companies:

*1st wave*: Build the monolith

*2nd wave*: Try to kill the monolith, but you can only change 40% with your microservice

*3rd wave*: Try to kill the two monoliths; the distributed one and the single one

=== *Quotes*

"Joining tables between different physical databases is possible in SQL Server o.O"


Netflix-oriented architecture: Very small microservices that
can connect with others through API


Core principles [they thought was good]:

  .. No data duplication
  .. Isolation and autonomy
  .. web APIs for everything
  .. "Bell on Bell" - removing the mainframe


*Conway's law*:

Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly)
will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the
organization's communication structure.


*Inverse Conway Maneuver*:

Design the organization you want, the architecture will
follow, kicking and screaming.


=== *Recommendations*

1. You own your SLA or your SLA owns you
2. They're called "fallacies"
  .. The network is always reliable
  .. Latency is zero
  .. Bandwidth is infinite
  .. The network is secure
  .. Topology doesn't change
  .. There is one administrator
  .. Transport cost is zero
  .. The network is homogeneous

3. You can't build a search service without duplication of data
4. Look for circuit-break pattern for microservices
5. Remove temporal coupling!
