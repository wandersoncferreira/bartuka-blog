=== *Thoughts*

The macro system in Emacs is very powerful. There are many
different hidden gems there. The *C-x C-k* prefix has a lot
of options, you should use *which-key* for sure in order to
learn in your daily basis.

I didn't know that I could store and name macros for further
usage. This is very good.

I should really read more the Emacs Manuals, all this
information is in there waiting to be discovered.

=== *Quotes*

Keyboard macros is basically recording a key sequence that
you can replay again later.

You can start the recording of a macro with: F3 or *C-x (*

You can stop the recording of a macro with: F4  or *C-x )*

You can execute the macro with: F4 or *C-x e*

If you want to append something to an earlier macro is to
use *C-u C-x (* and if you don't want to execute once you
can prefix the start of the macro with two *C-u*


=== *Recommendations*
1. Pay attention to chain keychords that is generic enough to be replayable.
2. _C-x C-k_ and *C-n* or *C-p* cycles into the macro ring
3. Naming the keyboard macro: C-x C-k n
4. Execute macro by its name, Alt-x <macro-name> [they are just like functions]
5. Alt-x insert-kbd-macro prints the definition of a named macro in pure Elisp
