=== *Speaker*
Alan Kay, creator of Smalltalk

=== *Thoughts*

Invention and incrementalism is only different from each
other by the size of the jump it provide from current
reality. Interesting definition of instrumentalist and
innovators: when a new idea appears, instrumentalist thinks
about how this new thing can *improve* their *current*
goals, while innovators often *rethink* and look for entire
new goals/possibilities.

"For most things, knowledge dominates IQ"

=== *Quotes*

Everybody loves change, except by the *change* part

People hate learning curves

When something is really new, you can barely see it

Conscience is only a waken dream with more constrains about
the things that is happening around us

Problem solving is too small an idea for *design and
architecture*, the essential process is *problem finding*

=== *Recommendations*

1. We should strive for creations that change the context
that we are used to think
2. The Present is the least important time we live in.
3. Look at the past as something more broad and sampling the past we should be able to assemble something really new to the future.
