=== *Speaker*
Uncle Bob, one of authors of the Agile Manifesto

=== *Thoughts*

Good history recap about the history of Computers in our
world. It's sad to see the devastating decrease of women in
the field.

No TDD, therefore: There are programmers into the world that
do not test their code.

I agree with the ethics and standards of programming that
must be enforced somehow in the business world. The lawers,
doctors and engineers has many many ways to get away from
trouble because of things like that.


=== *Quotes*
What very young men lack in discipline, they make up for in energy.

Those original programmers knew how to get big things done.

But business doesn't understand us, so they can't evaluate,
endorse, or approve any technical practices.

An efficient business discipline coupled to an undisciplined
engineering team will very rapidly make a mess.

=== *Notes*

==== Agile requires discipline

- Working in fixed time boxes
- Estimating in relative units
- Customer communication
- Continuous integration
- Collaboration
- And so much more...


==== Extreme programming

- TDD
- Refactoring
- Simple Design
- Acceptance Tests
- Metaphor

=== *Recommendations*
1. Agile: The process used by disciplined professionals observed in the wild.
2. Agile requires discipline
3. We have to get a way to enforce our ethics and standards
