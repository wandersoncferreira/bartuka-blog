=== *Speaker*
John Hughes, creator of QuickCheck

=== *Thoughts*

One nice demonstration about the powers of QuickCheck. These
two languages will be at my journey sometime in the future:
Erland and Haskell.

Tech yourself programming in 10 years they say.

=== *Quotes*

You can't test everything. Where should you stop?

The _same_ property can find _many_ different bugs

When you have a bug that happens only some times at months
it smells like _race condition_ problems

=== *Recomendations*

1. Don't write tests! Generate them.
2. Property based testing: finds more bugs with less effort!
3. Don't write tests! Generate them.
