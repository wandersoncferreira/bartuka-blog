=== *Speaker*
Alexander Yakushev, developer at Clojure on Android

=== *Thoughts*

I was thinking about this when I tried to use re-natal to
build my Android app. If most of the people today uses Java
to write Android apps, how can I use Clojure directly
instead?

And this presentation is the answer to this old
question. Unfortunately, I saw the repository today and it
looks like not being maintained anymore. All projects needs
people or they are doomed by single efforts of heroic
people.

Great initiative Alexander.


=== *Quotes*

Arguments for Clojure-Android: Closer to native platform,
easier to learn for android developers


Arguments for ClojureScript + X: Faster startup time, Easier
to dive in for web developers, potential to write
(kinda-)cross platform applications


=== *Recommendations*
1. https://github.com/clojure-android/lein-droid[lein-droid]: plugin for leiningen: handles compilation, packaging, minification, and deployment to the device

2. https://github.com/clojure-android/neko[neko] is a clojure-android toolkit library: wraps different Android API facilities, takes care of dynamic compilation, REPL and CIDER.

3. Project Skummet is an optimizing Clojure Compiler.

4. We need people
