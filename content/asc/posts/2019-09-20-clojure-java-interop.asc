=== *Thoughts*

I had to use some pure-Java libraries to deal with XSLX data
format lazily and that was a very simple learning curve for
a person that has never programmed in Java before (me!). For
some reason, I had never thought about using Clojure *from*
Java.

=== *Code Nice Examples*

Java - Chaining
[source,java]
----
person.getAddress().getZipCode()
----
Clojure - Chaining
[source,clojure]
----
(.. person getAddress getZipCode)
----
