=== *Speaker*
Kent Beck, Facebook Advisor Programmer


=== *Thoughts*

I hardly can comment on Extreme Programming for now, but the
ideas that Kent is telling are no much distant from common
sense in a way.

For me, is very plausible that he came with all the basics
for this framework only by _making stuff up_. After awhile,
he noticed that everything was well funded in experience
reports.

=== *Quotes*

Extreme Programming has three weeks interaction with stories
and testing

If you have a dump idea, figure out the most cheap way to
try it out. They are always worth trying

I am the owner of my code and I am responsible for its
quality and performance

Extreme Programming matches the behavior of programmers in
the wild


=== *Recomendations*
1. I may need to experiment Smalltalk for a while
2. Always be informed by data
