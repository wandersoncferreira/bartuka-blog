=== *Speaker*
Martin Fowler, Chief Scientist at ThoughtWorks

=== *Thoughts*

Small keynote but with good ideas about software
architecture. I really like the work of Martin Fowler and
his view over this problem, I feel how hard it is to move at
the speed that startups needs/desire and keep good
architecture choices around. The business domain is
constantly changing, priorities are crazy depending on the
week and the idea of losing the race because we can't
provide better solution now instead of "so-so" solutions is
terrifying.

Maybe this environment is just doomed to be re-written if
the company turns out successful. Internal quality is hard
to be taken into consideration specially when even
high-quality workers are so scarce in the market.


=== *Quotes*
Expert developers' shared understandinf of the system design is architecture

The set of design decisions that you wish you could get right early on

Architecture is a social thing

=== *Recomendations*
1. What you want to do, when project grows is that everybody has a shared understanding
2. What we consider to be the most important thing of the system?
