=== *Speaker*
Dan North, creator of BDD

=== *Thoughts*


=== *Quotes*

Kata is optimizing you for the wrong thing. You are learning
to perform which means minimize variance.

Deliberate learning = maximizing discovering

Koan leads you to Satori which is a moment of realization

=== *Recommendations*
1. Dojo/Kata should not be what geeks should be doing in their spaire time
2. When you are writing software you are not performing. Kata and Dojos does not matter
3. Zen buddhism, the Koan is a puzzle without any concrete answer
4. Conferences are great places to learn new stuff you don't even knew was possible to be learnt =)
