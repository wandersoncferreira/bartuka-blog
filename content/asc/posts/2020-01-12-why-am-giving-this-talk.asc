=== *Speaker*
Malcolm Gladwell, writer.

=== *Thoughts*

We do things that are irrational.

Very interesting talk! It makes a lot of sense, the relative
position around you matters the most in real life. No one
cares if you are in the top company, but in the bottom of
their foodchain.

Everybody wants to be at the top!

=== *Quotes*

Persistence in Science and Math is not a simply function of
their IQ

The kids who get the science and math degrees are the ones
in the top of their class


=== *Recommendations*

1. Look for relative deprivation theory
2. We as human beings underestimate the cost of being at the bottom of a hierarchy
3. Relative positions matters more than absolute positions
