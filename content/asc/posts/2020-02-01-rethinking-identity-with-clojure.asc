=== *Speaker*
David Nolen, ClojureScript core developer.

=== *Thoughts*

Vouch is very interesting. I think it will be necessary to
improve my skills around front-end development because the
leverage of using the same language in both places is very
appealling.

=== *Quotes*

Rich Hickey was the one who proved that persistent data
structure is really possible to be used in modern software.

Go back to the basics of the problem and try to decompose
the pre-conceptions in attempt to simplify the problem.

Complexity is contagious -> Complexity is a liability.

"If you can build your own tools, languages and operating
systems, then you absolutely should because the leverage
that can be obtained (and often the time not wasted in
trying to fix other people's not quite right tools) can be
incredible ..." - Alan Kay


=== *Recommendations*
1. Better ergonomics for end users!
2. https://youtu.be/Rk76BurH384[We don't really know how to compute] - by Gerry Sussman
3. Find the sources of complexity and when you find it - decomplect
4. Complexity isn't just confined to technical elements, often end users will the shoulder the burden
