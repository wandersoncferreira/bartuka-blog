=== *Speaker*
Dan North, creator of BDD

=== *Thoughts*

All I can say is that everybody should watch all Dan North
videos online. I can refer the content to any programmer I
know and he will be very uncomfortable with the truth: _your
goal should not be fighting over who write the most
idiomatic Javascript code, you should be performing
**business impact**_

=== *Quotes*

"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."

=== *References*

Necessity is the mother of invention... Grace Hopper,
invents the compiler.

Beyond developer, We are:

.. a developer

.. in a team

.. building a product

.. on a platform

.. in a department

.. in an organisation


a developer

.. learns the language

.. learns the libraries

.. monitors the alternatives

.. learns the toolchain

.. engages with the community

=== *Recommendations*
