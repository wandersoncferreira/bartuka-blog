=== *Thoughts*

I need to study a bit more about cljs. However, I am not so
inclined to the front-end world which increases the
dificulty of staying focused in any project on that end.

I found interesting to see how many inference algorithms
they need to understand clojure-code and translate it to
javascript correctly.


=== *Quotes*

*type:* a set of values might be considered at type

*type hinting:* you are helping the compiler to figure out the types

*type inference:* a set of algorithms the compiler uses to figure out the types in your system

*type checking:* verify when something does not match up


=== *Recommendations*
1. Pay attention to what you are typing hinting
2. Type hint is not a game you want to be playing because is not simple to realize if what you did helped or not
