=== *Speaker*
Gerry Sussman, author of SICP

=== *Thoughts*

It took me two days digesting this material to glance what
Gerry is talking about. Several aspects of his talk is
intriguing and let a lot of uncertainty about how computer
science will be in the future.

First, all we know today is from an Era of scarcity that is no
longer valid. Few technologies today takes this fact into
consideration to produce something really game changing
e.g. Datomic.

Second, our programs are not capable of *evolving*. Changing
software is really hard and the world is demanding this
behavior. It is very weird to enter a room with your CEO,
COO, and tell them in the middle of a discussion that you
**cannot** do something with your software (or it will be an
enormous effort to do so.)

I need to find more materials from Gerry Sussman in order to
fully appreciate these ideas.

=== *Quotes*

All our intuition about programming came from a world where
there were a sense of scarcity. But we need to evolve, we
are not there anymore.

Evolving and maintaining computer systems is expensive. This
cost can be anywhere from 50% of total programming effort to
75% of total available effort. In addition, the proportion
of effort devoted to maintainance has been increasing: from
35-40% in the 19s, through 40-60% in the 1980s up to 70-80%
in the 1990s. - Huw Evans

The propagator idea; Independent stateless machine;
connecting stateful cells

=== *Recommendations*
1. The cost of computation nowadays is the cost of the programmers
2. We need to find ways to minimize the cost of changing the decisions we made
3. The problem is evolvability not correctness
4. Propagator architecture unlocks freedoms
