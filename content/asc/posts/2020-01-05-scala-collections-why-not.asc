=== *Speaker*
Paul Phillips, co-founder of Typesafe

=== *Thoughts*

Yes, complexity all over the place. The small project I have
with Scala was done in 2017 and back at that time I was very
eager to start using Functional Programming Languages.

I find really complicated to manage all the type system
required. It has little logic to me. So, I left that out
there.

=== *Quotes*

When I'm working on a problem, I never think about beauty. I
think only how to solve the problem.

But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful,
I know it is *wrong*.

He wrote a least 3 million lines of code in Scala.. what?..

Is Scala too complex? Yes

All manner of behavior is ill-defined, which means users
have to program defensively and compiler team cannot
optimize


=== *Recomendations*

1. Make beautiful code
2. Does not let implementation details infest everything
