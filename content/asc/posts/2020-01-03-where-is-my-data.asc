=== *Thoughts*

I like the idea expressed in Datomic because of the
simplicity of the model. I confess that I haven't studied as
much as I did with Datomic to other databases such as
PostgreSQL, but the idea of distributed database and
immutability has very nice properties.


I am currently working in a project using Datomic as my core
database. Let's see how this experience is going to turn
out.


=== *Quotes*

Entity: a collection of facts with the same entity id

The attributes themselves are entities.

Datomic maintains a small segment of your database at the
client level


=== *Code snippets*

Returns a collection
[source,clojure]
----
[:find [?e ...]
 :where
  [?e :artist/country :contry/ES]]
----

How to express a join, also called *conjunction*:
[source,clojure]
----
[:find [?e ...]
 :where
  [?e :artist/country :contry/ES]
  [?e :artist/type    :artist.type/group]
  [?r :release/artists ?e]
  [?r :release/year 1970]]
----


How to express an explicit *or*, also called *disjunction*:
[source,clojure]
----
[:find [?e ...]
 :where
  [?e :artist/country :contry/ES]
  [?e :artist/type    :artist.type/group]
  [?r :release/artists ?e]
  (or [?r :release/year 1970]
      [?r :release/year 1980])]
----


=== *Recomendations*

1. put more restrictive patterns first
