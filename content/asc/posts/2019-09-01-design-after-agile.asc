=== *Thoughts*

I still create several diagrams about portion of my
code. After I discovered https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] all
my diagrams are plain text files that create the figures as
I compile in Emacs, you can even render on github/gitlab
issue tickets & PR's. However, I still need to be more
dilligent to reach these files *before* going to
code. Sometimes I find that experimenting with real code
helps me to see clearer and sometimes is just waste of
time. Life is hard, right?

=== *Quotes*

*plans* are useless, but *planning* is indispensable.

=== *Recommendations*

1. Make diagrams
2. Make tables
3. Write prose
