Cal Newport, author of the book


=== *Thoughts*

I think you should always aware of the opportunities. Follow
opportunities was what led me to where I am. I did not
engage in the university because I love physics or something
else, I was thinking only that I could not start to work
dealing with public in general and I wanted to postpone this
necessity and College and Military services were my two
opportunities at that time.

I tried both.


Situations like that happened severaaall times from 2010 to
today. 10 years later I do not regret any decision I made, I
am curious about different roads I could had travelled. But
that's all.


=== *Quotes*

Follow your passion

Why do some people love what they do for a living and some
people don't?

Steve Jobs were not passion about changing the world through
technology from the very beginning because his actions in
the past

Very rare to find people that knew in advance what were
really passionate about

Trying to figure out in the *abstract* what you should do
with your carrer is a tragit mistake.

Maybe more general treats that matter in the end.


An early on interest may  cause a snowball effect. You start
to  study and  it gives  you more  motivation to  endure the
deliberate practice that takes to  be very very good at what
you do.


=== *Recomendations*

4. The specifics that you do, might be less important
5. Have a period to build up a very valuable field
6. I want to be so good, that they can't ignore me
7. Find people that inspires you. Find how to get there
