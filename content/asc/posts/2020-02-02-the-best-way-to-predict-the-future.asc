=== *Speaker*
Alan Kay

=== *Thoughts*

Alan Kay has very crazy ideas and his talks are very
confusing at first. You have to stop and think about the
implications of what he is saying.

I have this feeling that sometimes when you know too much
about a subject that is not *concrete* it is very hard to
express your ideas, because sometimes they are not even
ideas yet, they are only feelings, hints, not coherent
thoughts and so on.

This might be the sign we should pay attention and try to
unscramble all the mess and see what is hiding behind it.

=== *Quotes*

"We cannot solve our problems with the same levels of
thinking that we used to create them" - by Albert Einstein

"In other words, we humans have *very bad braings*! From our
genetics, our cultures, our languages and our schools!" - by
Francis Bacon


=== *Recommendations*
1. Francis meant we should invent and use the new "methods" to help with every kind of thinking.
2. Help the elementary school teachers to create the children that will invent the healthy future
3. Book: The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History
