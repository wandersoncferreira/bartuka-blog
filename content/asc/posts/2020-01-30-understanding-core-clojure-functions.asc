=== *Speaker*
Dr. Jonathan Graham, Mined Minds

=== *Thoughts*

Very nice idea. I will try to start a project about it.

=== *Quotes*

Are you fully in control when you code?

**Property-based tests**

Make statements about the expected behaviour of the code
that should hold true for the entire domain of possible
inputs. These statements are then verified for many
different (pseudo)randomly generated inputs.

=== *Recommendations*
1. Write your own versions of core functions
2. Use property-based tests to validate your implementation
3. The TDD approach is very interesting for this kind of task
