=== *Thoughts*

How I like to use this tool! You can learn so much about
software development with Emacs that is amazing. You will
probably see more content of this web-series about Emacs.

But this sort of thing demand practice and curiosity. I have
some blog posts about how to master Emacs in portuguese to
help people to get started.

The most important thing is: keep yourself practicing and
push yourself to the limits of "there must be a better way
to do that" attitude.

Some keychords for you from the video!

=== *Recommendations*

Just use Emacs for a while, please.
